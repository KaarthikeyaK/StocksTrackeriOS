## Overview

Welcome to the Crypto App, a cutting-edge cryptocurrency tracking application that leverages the power of the MVVM architecture, the CoinGecko API, and the Combine framework. This app empowers users to access real-time data about cryptocurrencies, including market statistics and 7-day sparkline charts. Users can also manage their cryptocurrency portfolios, with data securely stored using Core Data.

## Features

### 1. MVVM Architecture

The Crypto App is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. This separation of concerns ensures that the codebase is organized, maintainable, and testable. The MVVM pattern enhances code readability and scalability, making it easier to expand and maintain the application.

### 2. CoinGecko API Integration

The app seamlessly integrates with the CoinGecko API to provide users with up-to-date information about cryptocurrency coins. This includes details such as coin names, symbols, prices, market caps, and 24-hour percentage changes.

### 3. Combine Framework for Asynchronous Operations

The app harnesses the power of the Combine framework for handling asynchronous operations and data flow. Combine enables elegant and efficient handling of data streams, making it a crucial component in achieving real-time updates and seamless interactions.

### 4. Portfolio Management with Core Data

Users can create and manage their cryptocurrency portfolios within the app. Core Data is used to securely store portfolio data on the device. This feature allows users to track their investments and make informed decisions.

### 5. 7-Day Sparkline Charts

The Crypto App provides users with visual insights into cryptocurrency price trends over the past 7 days. Sparkline charts are used to illustrate historical data, helping users analyze coin performance and make investment choices.

## Learnings

The development of this app has led to valuable insights, particularly in the utilization of the Combine framework. Key learnings include:

- **Combine's Power**: Combine proved to be a powerful tool that simplifies asynchronous operations and data flow. Even small changes in variables can have a significant impact on the entire application, demonstrating the interconnected nature of Combine.

- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Combine significantly reduces code complexity by facilitating the seamless flow of data between components. Subscribing to publishers and reacting to changes in real-time simplifies application development.

## Upcoming Features

The Crypto App is continuously evolving. Future updates will include:

- **Stock Integration**: Expanding beyond cryptocurrencies, the app plans to include stock data, providing users with a comprehensive financial tracking tool.
